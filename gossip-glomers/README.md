Slowly enjoying the `fly.io` [Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) series of challenges to learn both concurrent rust and brush up distributed systems algorithms.

Each directory is a solution to one of the challenges. The more the challenges progress in complexity the better the code adapts.

1. [unique_ids](unique_ids/)
1. [broadcast_a](broadcast_a/)
1. [broadcast_b](broadcast_b/)
